# Re-fracture UCB study
This is a repository for UCB Re-fracture study.

# Research Questions
1. To describe the characteristics of postmenopausal women with an imminent subsequent fracture

2. To describe the incidence of imminent subsequent fractures (fractures within 2 years after an index fracture) amongst postmenopausal women

3. To estimate the impact of an imminent subsequent fracture on healthcare resource utilisation and direct costs amongst postmenopausal wo

## Running the analysis
1) Download this entire repository (you can download as a zip folder using Code -> Download ZIP, or you can use GitHub Desktop). 
2) Open the project <i>RefractureStudy.Rproj</i> in RStudio (when inside the project, you will see its name on the top-right of your RStudio session)
3) Open and work though the <i>CodeToRun.R</i> file which should be the only file that you need to interact with. Run the lines in the file, adding your database specific information and so on (see comments within the file for instructions). The last line of this file will run the study <i>(source(here("RunStudy.R"))</i>.     
4) After running you should then have a zip folder with results to share in your output folder.
